# __name__ == '__main__':
The if __name__ == '__main__': statement is a conditional statement that checks whether the script is being run as the main program or if it's being imported as a module into another program. The statement is used to control the execution of code in the script and to prevent certain code from running when the script is imported into another program.

When a Python script is executed, Python sets the special __name__ variable to the string '__main__'. This allows you to check if the script is being run as the main program or not. If the script is being run as the main program, the block of code inside the if __name__ == '__main__': statement will be executed. If the script is being imported as a module into another program, the block of code will be skipped.

Some use cases for including this conditional in your code are:

Running a test suite: You may want to have a separate file with all of your test cases for a module or package. You can use the if __name__ == '__main__': statement to run the test suite when the file is executed as the main program, but not when it's imported as a module.

Creating a command-line utility: You can use the if __name__ == '__main__': statement to define a command-line interface for your script. This way, users can run your script from the command line with different arguments to perform different tasks.

Running initialization code: You can use the if __name__ == '__main__': statement to run initialization code when the script is executed as the main program, but not when it's imported as a module. This can include setting up logging, creating database connections, or initializing global variables.
