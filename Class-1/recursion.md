# Recursion

**Recursion** is a technique in computer programming where a **function calls itself to perform a task *repeatedly* until a certain condition is met**. In Python, a recursive function is defined as a function that calls itself, either directly or indirectly, in its body.

The recursive function performs the task by breaking it down into **smaller subproblems**, and then **solves each subproblem by calling itself recursively.** The **recursion continues until a base case is reached,** at which point the function returns its result to the caller. **The base case is a simple case that can be solved directly without further recursion**.

Recursion can be a powerful tool for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems. It is **commonly used in algorithms for tree traversal, searching, and sorting.** However, recursion can also be inefficient and can lead to stack overflow errors if not implemented correctly.**It is important to ensure that the base case is reachable and that the recursion terminates at some point**.
