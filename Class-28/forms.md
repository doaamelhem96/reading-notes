# Models && Form in Django Framework
1. How do Django Forms facilitate user input handling, and what are some key components of creating a form using the Django framework?
   Django Forms provide a convenient way to handle user input in web applications. They simplify the process of validating user input, displaying form fields, and processing the submitted data. Key components of creating a form in Django include:
   - Defining a form class that inherits from `django.forms.Form` or `django.forms.ModelForm`.
   - Specifying the form fields and their validation rules using field classes provided by Django.
   - Rendering the form in HTML templates using template tags and filters.
   - Handling form submissions in views, validating the data, and performing appropriate actions.

2. Explain the purpose of Django Templates in web development and describe how template inheritance can be utilized to improve code reusability and maintainability.
   Django Templates are used for rendering dynamic HTML pages in web development. They separate the presentation logic from the business logic of the application. Template inheritance allows for code reusability and maintainability by creating a hierarchy of templates. A base template defines the common structure and layout of the web pages, and child templates extend or override specific sections of the base template. This allows for consistent styling, layout, and behavior across multiple pages while minimizing code duplication.

3. Describe the function of Django Views in handling HTTP requests and outline the differences between function-based views and class-based views.
   Django Views handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses. They encapsulate the logic for processing requests, interacting with models, rendering templates, and returning appropriate responses. Function-based views are defined as Python functions that take a request object and return a response. They are simple and easy to understand. On the other hand, class-based views are defined as classes that inherit from Django's `View` class or its subclasses. They provide a more structured approach and can encapsulate reusable behavior in mixins. Class-based views offer additional features such as easy method-based request handling and built-in support for common tasks like form handling and authentication.
