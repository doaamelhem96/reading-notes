1. **Django Rest Framework (DRF) Permissions:**
DRF provides a built-in permissions system that helps in securing APIs by controlling access to certain resources based on user roles or other conditions. The key components of DRF permissions are:

- **`AllowAny`:** This permission class allows unrestricted access to any user, meaning it doesn't enforce any restrictions on who can access the API.

- **`IsAuthenticated`:** This permission class ensures that only authenticated users can access the API endpoints. Unauthenticated users will be denied access.

- **`IsAdminUser`:** This permission class grants access only to admin users, which are typically staff users with administrative privileges.

- **`IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly`:** This permission class allows authenticated users to perform any request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), but unauthenticated users are only allowed to read (GET) data.

- **Custom Permissions:** Apart from the built-in classes, DRF allows developers to define custom permission classes to suit specific business logic or requirements.

Permissions are applied to views or viewsets in Django Rest Framework, ensuring that only users with the appropriate permissions can perform certain actions on the API endpoints. By using these permissions, developers can control access to sensitive data or operations and enhance the security of the API.

2. **SQL SELECT Statement:**
The `SELECT` statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from a database table. It allows you to fetch specific columns or all columns from one or more tables, based on certain conditions or filters. To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees', the SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

The asterisk (*) is a wildcard that represents all columns in the specified table. This query will fetch all the rows from the 'employees' table and return all the columns present in each row.

3. **DRF Generic Views:**
DRF provides a set of generic views, which are pre-implemented views that can be used to perform common actions on resources (data) in a RESTful API without having to write the view logic from scratch. The main DRF generic views are:

- **`ListAPIView`:** Used for retrieving a list of resources from the database. It corresponds to the HTTP GET method.

- **`CreateAPIView`:** Used for creating a new resource. It corresponds to the HTTP POST method.

- **`RetrieveAPIView`:** Used for retrieving a single resource by its unique identifier. It corresponds to the HTTP GET method.

- **`UpdateAPIView`:** Used for updating an existing resource. It corresponds to the HTTP PUT method.

- **`DestroyAPIView`:** Used for deleting an existing resource. It corresponds to the HTTP DELETE method.

DRF Generic Views are designed to work with Django model instances and provide default behavior for common actions, but they are also customizable to accommodate specific requirements. Developers can subclass these views and override methods to tailor the behavior as needed.

Example usage of DRF Generic Views:

```python
from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView, RetrieveAPIView
from .models import Employee
from .serializers import EmployeeSerializer

class EmployeeListView(ListAPIView):
    queryset = Employee.objects.all()
    serializer_class = EmployeeSerializer

class EmployeeDetailView(RetrieveAPIView):
    queryset = Employee.objects.all()
    serializer_class = EmployeeSerializer
```

In this example, we create two views: `EmployeeListView` and `EmployeeDetailView`. The `ListAPIView` will handle GET requests to retrieve all employees, while the `RetrieveAPIView` will handle GET requests to retrieve a specific employee by their identifier. The `EmployeeSerializer` is used to convert the data to and from JSON format when interacting with the API.
