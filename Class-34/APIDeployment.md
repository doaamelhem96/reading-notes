1. Key Principles for Organizing and Configuring Django Settings:
   According to "Django Settings Best Practices," some key principles to follow when organizing and configuring Django settings for a project are as follows:

   a. Keep settings in a separate module: Store all your project settings in a dedicated Python module (e.g., settings.py) to keep them organized and easily accessible.

   b. Use environment variables: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in settings.py. Instead, use environment variables to store sensitive data like secret keys, database credentials, etc. This helps enhance security and makes it easier to manage different configurations for different environments (development, staging, production).

   c. Split settings into multiple files: As the project grows, settings.py can become lengthy and hard to maintain. Consider splitting the settings into multiple files (e.g., base.py, development.py, production.py) based on their purpose. Use the `from .base import *` pattern to import common settings into specific environment files and override only the necessary settings.

   d. Use Django-environ: Django-environ is a popular Python library that simplifies the process of loading environment variables and other configuration settings from a .env file. It helps manage settings more easily, especially in development environments.

   e. Secure sensitive data: Take care not to expose sensitive information (e.g., secret keys, database credentials) in version control or production logs. Use .gitignore to prevent versioning sensitive files and configure logging settings appropriately.

   f. Use default settings: Django provides default settings for most configurations. Leverage these defaults whenever possible and only override them if necessary.

   g. Document settings: Add comments and documentation to the settings file to explain the purpose and usage of each setting. This helps other developers and future maintainers understand the project configuration better.

2. White Noise Library for Serving Static Files in Django:
   White Noise is a Python library used to efficiently serve static files (e.g., CSS, JS, images) in a Django application. It is commonly used in production environments to handle static file serving with improved performance. Here are the steps to integrate White Noise into a Django project:

   a. Install White Noise: Install the White Noise library using pip.
      ```
      pip install whitenoise
      ```

   b. Configure Middleware: In the Django settings.py file, add White Noise to the MIDDLEWARE list. Place it before the Django's CommonMiddleware to allow White Noise to handle static files first.
      ```python
      MIDDLEWARE = [
          'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
          # Other middlewares...
          'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
          # Other middlewares...
      ]
      ```

   c. Collect Static Files: Run the `collectstatic` management command to collect static files from various apps into a single directory. White Noise will serve these files efficiently.
      ```
      python manage.py collectstatic
      ```

   d. Configure Static URL and Root: Make sure you have defined the STATIC_URL and STATIC_ROOT settings in settings.py.
      ```python
      STATIC_URL = '/static/'
      STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
      ```

   With White Noise integrated, the application will efficiently serve static files, and there will be no need to configure a separate static file server like Apache or Nginx.

3. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Django:
   CORS is a security feature implemented in web browsers to control access to resources (e.g., APIs) on different domains. It prevents web pages hosted on one domain from making unauthorized requests to resources hosted on another domain. When a web page hosted on one domain (origin) needs to make an HTTP request to another domain's API (different origin), the browser enforces the same-origin policy. CORS headers need to be correctly configured on the server-side to allow such cross-origin requests.

   In Django, you can use the Django CORS Headers library to implement CORS. Here are the steps to configure CORS in a Django project:

   a. Install Django CORS Headers: Install the Django CORS Headers library using pip.
      ```
      pip install django-cors-headers
      ```

   b. Add Middleware: In the Django settings.py file, add the CORS middleware to the MIDDLEWARE list. Place it as high as possible to handle CORS headers early in the request-response cycle.
      ```python
      MIDDLEWARE = [
          'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
          # Other middlewares...
      ]
      ```

   c. Configure Allowed Origins: Define the origins from which you want to allow cross-origin requests. Set the CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS setting in settings.py. You can use `'*'` to allow requests from any origin, but it's recommended to specify specific origins for better security.
      ```python
      CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
          'http://example.com',
          'https://subdomain.example.com',
      ]
      ```

   d. Configure Other CORS Settings: You can configure other CORS-related settings in settings.py, such as CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS, CORS_ALLOWED_METHODS, CORS_ALLOWED_HEADERS, etc., to control other aspects of CORS behavior.

   With CORS properly configured in a Django project, the server will include the necessary CORS headers in its responses, allowing the client-side code to make cross-origin requests to the defined allowed origins. This helps in building secure web applications that can interact with APIs from different domains.
