# Exception handling:
****
In Python allows you to **handle and recover from errors or exceptional situations** that may occur during the **execution of your code**. The core components of exception handling are the **try, except, and finally blocks**.
-----
****
1. The try block is used to **enclose the code that might ***raise*** an exception**. If an exception occurs within the **try block**, the code execution is **immediately transferred to the corresponding except block**.

2. The **except block** specifies the type of exception to **catch and handle**. If the exception raised matches the specified type, the code within the except block is **executed**. **You can have multiple except blocks** to ***handle different types of exceptions***.

3. The **finally block** is **optional** and is **used to specify code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not**.
