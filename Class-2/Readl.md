# Read and Readlins:
****
The difference between the **read()** and **readline()** methods for file **objects** in Python:

1. **read() method:** The read() method is used to read the entire content of a file as a **single string**. It reads **from the current position in the file up to the end**. Here's an example:

**with open('readme.md', 'r') as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print(contents)**
This will print the entire content of the file as a single string.

2. **readline() method:** The readline() method is used to read a single line from the file, moving the file pointer to the next line. Successive calls to readline() will read subsequent lines of the file. Here's an example:
**with open('readme.md', 'r') as file:
    line1 = file.readline()
    line2 = file.readline()
    print(line1)
    print(line2)**
This will print the first line of the file in line1 and the second line in line2.
******
**In summary, use the ***read***method when you want to read the entire content of a file as a ***single string***, and use the ***readline()*** method when you want to read the file ***line by line*** or selectively read specific lines.**
