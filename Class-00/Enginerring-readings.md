# Engineering Readings

When I solve and face any problem i will do :
1. **Make sure fully understand the problem**: I take the time to analyze it and identify what's causing the issue.

2. **Develop a plan for solving the problem**: This plan should be well-thought-out and consider all possible solutions. It's also important to **break the problem down** into **smaller** **subproblems**, as this can make it easier to manage and solve.

3. If i find myself stuck, i **stay calm and not get discouraged**. i Try going through my solution step by step to identify where i might have gone wrong. i could also consider looking at the code from a different angle or trying a new approach.

4. ***If all else fails***, I delete all ofmy code and start fresh in order to find the right solution. And i will remember, **the more you practice problem-solving, the better you'll become.**
 ***So*** **I keep working at it and I don't give up!**

 **I think my indivisual strength** is about *** I am trying to do all my best every-time** even i faced challenge i just thinking how i can solve it in specific time, i'm using technology efficiently to solve my problems, and communicate with other to solve my problems.
