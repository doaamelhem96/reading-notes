*****************
When deciding which data structure to use for solving a particular problem, it is important to recognize that no single data structure can optimally solve all problems.Thus, the selection of the most appropriate data structure should depend on:

1. The nature of the problem to be solved.
2. The operations to be performed and their frequency. For instance, one should choose a data structure that can efficiently support the required operations, such as adding, removing, searching, and sorting elements. Additionally, it is essential to ensure that recursive functions have base cases that terminate the recursion and avoid an infinite recursive call stack.

**Data structures** refer to specialized formats used for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data to meet a specific purpose. They provide a set of operations to work with data, and there are several types of data structures, including arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and hash tables. A compound data structure is one that contains multiple values or pieces of data. Big O notation is a technique used to describe the time complexity of an algorithm or how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases.
Examples of commonly used data structures include **nodes, linked lists, arrays, hash tables, double (stack + queue), graphs, and trees**. 
Recursive functions, which are functions that call themselves one or more times, can be divided into smaller subproblems and solved recursively.

#  Recursive Case
The **recursive case** is the part of the function that **calls itself** to solve a smaller subproblem, while the **base case** is the *stopping condition* for the recursive function.

# Time complexity and space complexity are two important concepts in computer science that help analyze the efficiency of algorithms.

### Time Complexity:
Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. It quantifies the number of operations an algorithm performs in the worst-case scenario. Time complexity is typically expressed using Big O notation.
Common time complexities:

O(1) - Constant Time: The algorithm takes a constant amount of time regardless of the input size.
O(log n) - Logarithmic Time: The algorithm's running time grows logarithmically with the input size.
O(n) - Linear Time: The algorithm's running time scales linearly with the input size.
O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time: The algorithm's running time is a product of the input size and its logarithm.
O(n^2) - Quadratic Time: The algorithm's running time grows quadratically with the input size.
O(2^n) - Exponential Time: The algorithm's running time grows exponentially with the input size.
Analyzing time complexity helps in evaluating how an algorithm's performance scales as the input size increases. It enables us to choose more efficient algorithms for solving problems.

### Space Complexity:
Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run as a function of the input size. It quantifies the additional space used by an algorithm apart from the input itself.
##### Common space complexities:

O(1) - Constant Space: The algorithm uses a fixed amount of memory, independent of the input size.
O(n) - Linear Space: The algorithm's space usage grows linearly with the input size.
O(n^2) - Quadratic Space: The algorithm's space usage grows quadratically with the input size.
Space complexity analysis helps assess how much memory an algorithm consumes and whether it can be optimized to reduce memory usage.

Both time complexity and space complexity provide valuable insights into an algorithm's efficiency. It's important to consider both aspects when evaluating and comparing different algorithms to choose the most suitable one for a given problem.
