**There are many efficient SQL instructions as:**
- CREATE for create table.
- DELETE for delete data from table.
- UPDATE for update table as update records on table.
- Insert for insert record on your table.
*******

 I observed that there are main differences between the DROP and DELETE table SQL operations. When you use the DROP TABLE command, you remove a table with its data and associations from the database, while DELETE doesn't do the same thing. Therefore, you should be sure when you decide to use either command.
