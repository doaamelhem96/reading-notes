# DataBase Managment:
**Database management** involves the **organization, maintenance, and utilization of data within a database system.** This includes tasks such as designing, creating, and maintaining databases, as well as **controlling access to data,** **ensuring data integrity and security,** and **optimizing the performance of the database system**.

# DataBase Managment Commands:
There are many **database management commands** that can be used to manage a database. The specific commands and syntax may vary depending on the type of database management system (DBMS) you are using. Here are some commonly used database management commands:
1. **CREATE DATABASE:** Creates a new database.

2. **CREATE TABLE:** Creates a new table in the database.

3. **ALTER TABLE:** Modifies an existing table, such as adding or deleting columns or changing the data type of a column.

4. **DROP TABLE:** Deletes a table from the database.

5. **SELECT:** Retrieves data from one or more tables based on specified criteria.

*****
**There are many efficient SQL Queries as:**
- CREATE for create table.
- DELETE for delete data from table.
- UPDATE for update table as update records on table.
- Insert for insert record on your table.
*******

 I observed that there are main differences between the DROP and DELETE table SQL operations. When you use the DROP TABLE command, you remove a table with its data and associations from the database, while DELETE doesn't do the same thing. Therefore, you should be sure when you decide to use either command.
