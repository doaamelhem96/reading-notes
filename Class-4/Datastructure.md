# Intro to Data Structure
In computer science, a linear data structure refers to a data structure in which elements are arranged sequentially, and each element has a unique predecessor and successor, except for the first and last elements. Common examples of linear data structures include arrays, linked lists, queues, and stacks.

The time complexity of operations performed on a linear data structure depends on the specific implementation and the operation being performed.
****
Here are the typical time complexities associated with common operations on linear data structures:

Accessing an element by index:

Arrays: O(1)
Linked lists: O(n)
Queues and stacks: O(n) or O(1), depending on whether accessing the front or top element.
Insertion/Deletion at the beginning:

Arrays: O(n)
Linked lists: O(1)
Queues and stacks: O(1)
Insertion/Deletion at the end:

Arrays (with dynamic resizing): Amortized O(1)
Linked lists: O(1)
Queues and stacks: O(1)
Insertion/Deletion at an arbitrary index:

Arrays: O(n)
Linked lists: O(n)
Queues and stacks: Not applicable (not typically supported)
Searching for an element:

Arrays: O(n)
Linked lists: O(n)
Queues and stacks: O(n)

#### In summary, the time complexity of operations on linear data structures can vary depending on the specific implementation. Generally, accessing elements by index or performing operations at the beginning or end can have different time complexities across different linear data structures. It's important to consider the requirements of your application and choose the appropriate linear data structure accordingly.

#### A linked list is a linear data structure in computer science that consists of a sequence of nodes. Each node contains two components: data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The last node in the list typically has a reference to null, indicating the end of the list.

Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous memory locations, a linked list uses dynamic memory allocation. Each node can be located at any memory address, and they are connected through the references in a chain-like fashion.

The fundamental building block of a linked list is the node. Each node contains data, which can be of any type, and a reference to the next node. By linking nodes together, you can create a linked list.

The linked list offers several advantages and disadvantages:

Advantages:

Dynamic size: Linked lists can grow or shrink as needed, as memory allocation is performed dynamically.
Efficient insertion and deletion: Adding or removing elements from a linked list can be efficient, especially when working with the head or tail of the list.
Flexibility: Linked lists allow efficient insertion and deletion at any position, unlike arrays that may require shifting elements.
Disadvantages:

Sequential access: Accessing an element by index in a linked list requires traversing through the nodes from the head until the desired position is reached, resulting in slower random access compared to arrays.
Extra memory: Linked lists require extra memory to store the references to the next nodes.
Lack of direct access: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not support direct access to arbitrary elements.
Overall, linked lists are a versatile data structure that can be used in various scenarios. They are commonly used when frequent insertion and deletion operations are required, or when the size of the data structure needs to change dynamically.
