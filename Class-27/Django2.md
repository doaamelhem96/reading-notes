1. Purpose and Basic Structure of Django Models:
   - Django models are Python classes that represent database tables and define the structure and behavior of the data.
   - They help in creating and managing the database schema by providing an object-relational mapping (ORM) layer.
   - Models define fields to represent attributes of the data, such as CharField for a string, IntegerField for an integer, etc.
   - Models also define relationships between different data entities, such as ForeignKey, OneToOneField, ManyToManyField, etc.
   - They enable CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the data and provide methods and queries to interact with the database.
   - The basic structure of a Django model includes the class name, field definitions, and optional meta options for customization.

2. Features and Functionality of Django Admin Interface:
   - The Django Admin interface is a built-in feature that provides a user-friendly interface for managing the data in the database.
   - It automatically generates forms and views based on the models defined in the application.
   - It allows administrators to create, view, update, and delete records in the database without writing any code.
   - The Admin interface supports filtering, searching, sorting, and pagination of data.
   - It includes features like automatic URL routing, permissions and authentication, customizable templates, and support for multiple languages.
   - The Admin interface can be customized by creating ModelAdmin classes to define the display, behavior, and permissions of models.
   - Customizations can include adding custom fields, customizing the list and detail views, adding actions, overriding templates, etc.

3. Key Components and Workflow of a Django Application:
   - The key components of a Django application are models, views, templates, and URLs.
   - Models define the data structure and behavior of the application.
   - Views handle the logic and processing of requests and responses.
   - Templates provide the presentation and rendering of data.
   - URLs map the incoming URLs to the appropriate views.
   - The workflow of a Django application starts with a user making a request to a specific URL.
   - The URL is matched to a view function or class based on the URL configuration.
   - The view processes the request, interacts with models and databases, and prepares data for rendering.
   - The view then renders a template with the data to generate an HTML response.
   - The response is sent back to the user's browser for display.
   - Django provides a URL dispatcher, model ORM, template engine, and request/response handling to facilitate this workflow.
   - Additional components like forms, middleware, and static files handling can also be part of the application to enhance functionality.

Overall, Django provides a comprehensive framework for developing web applications by leveraging models, the Admin interface, and the interaction between models, views, templates, and URLs. It simplifies database management, provides an administrative interface, and follows a clear workflow for building robust web applications.
