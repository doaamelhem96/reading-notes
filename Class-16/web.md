## Differences between Scraping Static and Dynamic Websites:

1. HTML Structure: Static websites have a fixed HTML structure that remains constant over time. The content is directly available in the HTML source code, making it relatively easier to extract information using traditional parsing techniques. On the other hand, dynamic websites rely on client-side rendering and AJAX requests to load content dynamically. The HTML structure of dynamic websites may change frequently, and the content may be loaded asynchronously, requiring additional techniques to extract data effectively.

2. JavaScript Execution: Static websites usually do not rely heavily on JavaScript for content rendering, so scraping static websites often does not require executing JavaScript code. However, dynamic websites heavily rely on JavaScript to generate and modify the content dynamically. To scrape dynamic websites, you need to execute JavaScript code to fetch and render the dynamic content before extracting the desired information.

3. Data Availability: Static websites typically have all the necessary data available in the HTML source code, making it relatively straightforward to extract the desired information. In contrast, dynamic websites may require making additional requests or interacting with APIs to obtain the required data. Scraping dynamic websites may involve handling AJAX requests, interacting with JavaScript frameworks, or mimicking user behavior to access the desired content.

Techniques to Avoid Getting Blocked While Scraping Websites:

1. Respect Robots.txt: The Robots Exclusion Protocol, commonly known as robots.txt, is a file that website owners use to communicate instructions to web crawlers and scrapers. It specifies which parts of the website are allowed or disallowed for crawling. Adhering to the directives in the robots.txt file is a best practice to avoid getting blocked. Ensure that your scraper respects the rules defined in the robots.txt file of the target website.

2. Implement Rate Limiting: Sending a large number of requests to a website in a short period can trigger anti-scraping mechanisms and lead to IP blocking. To avoid this, implement rate limiting in your scraper. Control the frequency of requests by introducing delays between successive requests to mimic human-like browsing behavior. Be mindful of the website's acceptable request rate and adjust your scraper accordingly to stay under the radar.

3. Use Proxies and User Agents: Rotating IP addresses through proxy servers and randomizing user agents can help prevent detection and blocking. By using a pool of proxies, you can distribute your scraping requests across different IP addresses, making it difficult for the target website to associate them with a single source. Additionally, rotating user agents (browser headers) with each request can help mask the identity of your scraper.

4. Use Session Persistence: Websites may use cookies or session tokens to track user activity and identify bots or scrapers. Maintain session persistence by handling cookies and preserving the session state between requests. This can help you emulate a browsing session more effectively and reduce the likelihood of being detected as a bot.

5. Implement Captcha Solving Mechanisms: Some websites employ CAPTCHA challenges to prevent automated scraping. To overcome this, you may need to implement mechanisms to automatically solve CAPTCHAs. There are third-party services and libraries available that can assist in solving CAPTCHAs programmatically.

It's important to note that while these techniques can help mitigate the risk of getting blocked while scraping websites, it's essential to comply with the target website's terms of service and respect their data usage policies. Always ensure that you are scraping websites responsibly and ethically.
