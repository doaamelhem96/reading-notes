1. Key characteristics of serverless computing:
   - Event-driven: Serverless computing is based on the concept of triggering functions in response to events, such as HTTP requests, database changes, or timer events.
   - Automatic scaling: Serverless platforms handle the scaling of resources automatically, allocating resources as needed based on the incoming workload.
   - Pay-per-use billing: With serverless, you pay only for the actual usage of resources and functions, rather than paying for idle resources.
   - Stateless: Serverless functions are designed to be stateless, meaning they don't store any persistent state between invocations. Instead, they rely on external storage or services to manage state.

   Differences from traditional server-based architectures:
   - Serverless computing eliminates the need for managing and provisioning servers. Developers can focus solely on writing functions without worrying about server infrastructure.
   - In server-based architectures, developers need to manage server configurations, scaling, and deployment, whereas serverless platforms handle these aspects automatically.
   - Serverless functions are typically short-lived and triggered by events, whereas server-based architectures often involve long-running processes or services.

2. Getting started with Vercel and deploying a serverless function:
   - Sign up for a Vercel account at https://vercel.com/.
   - Install the Vercel CLI by running `npm install -g vercel` in your command line.
   - Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the command line.
   - Initialize your project with Vercel using `vercel init`.
   - Write your serverless function in a file (e.g., `api/myfunction.js`) within your project directory.
   - Deploy your project to Vercel using `vercel --prod`.
   - Vercel will provide you with a URL where your serverless function is deployed and accessible.

3. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):
   - APIs define a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.
   - They provide a way to access and manipulate data or functionality from external sources, such as web services or databases.
   - APIs can be used to retrieve data, update data, perform actions, or integrate with third-party services.

4. Utilizing APIs in Python applications:
   - Python provides various libraries, such as `requests`, for making HTTP requests to APIs and handling the responses.
   - By utilizing APIs in Python applications, you can fetch data from external sources, send data to external services, or interact with web services programmatically.
   - APIs usually require authentication (e.g., API keys, access tokens) to ensure authorized access to their resources.

5. The Requests library in Python:
   - The Requests library is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests and handling responses in a user-friendly manner.
   - It simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests, handling headers, managing cookies, and processing responses.
   - Here's an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/users")
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()  # Convert response to JSON format
    print(data)
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code)
```

In this example, we use the `get()` function from the Requests library to send a GET request to "https://api.example.com/users". The response is then checked for a successful status code (200), and if successful, the response data is printed.
