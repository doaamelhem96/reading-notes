## 1. Key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh:
   - Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library that provides a wide range of plotting functionalities. It offers low-level control over individual plot elements and allows for highly customized visualizations. Matplotlib is suitable for creating basic to complex plots and is often used for scientific and statistical visualizations.
   - Seaborn: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a higher-level interface for creating aesthetic and informative statistical graphics. It offers various pre-defined visualizations, such as categorical plots, distribution plots, and regression plots, which make it easy to create visually appealing plots with minimal code. Seaborn is particularly useful for exploratory data analysis and data visualization in statistical contexts.
   - Bokeh: Bokeh is a library focused on interactive visualizations and is designed to create web-ready, interactive plots. It provides interactive tools and interactivity with JavaScript-based widgets, allowing users to explore and interact with the plots in real time. Bokeh is suitable for creating interactive dashboards, data exploration tools, and interactive visualizations for web applications.

   Example of suitable visualization for each library:
   - Matplotlib: A line plot showing the trend of stock prices over time.
   - Seaborn: A box plot showing the distribution of salaries across different job titles.
   - Bokeh: An interactive scatter plot that allows users to explore the relationship between two variables by hovering over the data points.

2. Main functions in Seaborn for creating different types of plots:
   - Relational plots: Seaborn provides functions like `scatterplot()` and `lineplot()` for creating relational plots. These plots help visualize the relationship between two or more variables, showing patterns, trends, or correlations.
   - Categorical plots: Functions such as `barplot()`, `boxplot()`, and `violinplot()` in Seaborn are used to create categorical plots. These plots are useful for visualizing categorical data, comparing groups or categories, and identifying distributions or outliers within categories.
   - Distribution plots: Seaborn offers functions like `histplot()`, `kdeplot()`, and `rugplot()` for creating distribution plots. These plots allow visualizing the distribution of a single variable, providing insights into its central tendency, spread, and shape.

   Example use case:
   - Relational plot: Creating a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the age and income of individuals in a dataset.
   - Categorical plot: Creating a bar plot to compare the average sales across different product categories.
   - Distribution plot: Creating a histogram to visualize the distribution of exam scores in a class.

3. Role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet:
   The Seaborn Cheat Sheet serves as a quick reference guide for Python developers working with the Seaborn library. It provides a concise overview of the various functionalities and features of Seaborn, making it easier to find the appropriate functions and syntax for specific visualization tasks. 

   Key sections and elements in the cheat sheet include:
   - Functions: It lists the main functions in Seaborn categorized by plot types, such as relational, categorical, and distribution plots.
   - Syntax examples: It provides example code snippets illustrating the syntax and usage of different Seaborn functions.
   - Parameters: It highlights the commonly used parameters for each function, allowing developers to customize their visualizations.
   - Color palettes: It showcases the available color palettes in Seaborn, which can be used to enhance the aesthetics of plots.
   - Style options: It introduces the different built-in styles in Seaborn that developers can apply to their plots for consistent and visually appealing results.

   Overall, the Seaborn Cheat Sheet serves as a valuable
